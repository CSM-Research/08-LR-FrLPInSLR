abstract = {An increasingly popular set of techniques adopted by software engineering (SE) researchers to automate development tasks are those rooted in the concept of Deep Learning (DL). The popularity of such techniques largely stems from their automated feature engineering capabilities, which aid in modeling software artifacts. However, due to the rapid pace at which DL techniques have been adopted, it is difficult to distill the current successes, failures, and opportunities of the current research landscape. In an effort to bring clarity to this cross-cutting area of work, from its modern inception to the present, this article presents a systematic literature review of research at the intersection of SE &amp; DL. The review canvasses work appearing in the most prominent SE and DL conferences and journals and spans 128 papers across 23&nbsp;unique SE tasks. We center our analysis around the components of learning, a set of principles that governs the application of machine learning techniques (ML) to a given problem domain, discussing several aspects of the surveyed work at a granular level. The end result of our analysis is a research roadmap that both delineates the foundations of DL techniques applied to SE research and highlights likely areas of fertile exploration for the future.},

abstract = {Software development is a collaborative task and, hence, involves different persons. Research has shown the relevance of social aspects in the development team for a successful and satisfying project closure. Especially the mood of a team has been proven to be of particular importance. Thus, project managers or project leaders want to be aware of situations in which negative mood is present to allow for interventions. So-called sentiment analysis tools offer a way to determine the mood based on text-based communication. In this paper, we present the results of a systematic literature review of sentiment analysis tools developed for or applied in the context of software engineering. Our results summarize insights from 80 papers with respect to (1) the application domain, (2) the purpose, (3) the used data sets, (4) the approaches for developing sentiment analysis tools and (5) the difficulties researchers face when applying sentiment analysis in the context of software projects. According to our results, sentiment analysis is frequently applied to open-source software projects, and most tools are based on support-vector machines. Despite the frequent use of sentiment analysis in software engineering, there are open issues, e.g., regarding the identification of irony or sarcasm, pointing to future research directions.},

abstract = {Context: Systematic Literature Review (SLR) or Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) are a process in which publications dataset is systematically analyzed to cover a research field. These processes involve multiple investigators collaborating to produce more improved work and often use automated tools to facilitate their work. Problem: However, not all tools offer proper support to collaborative SLR or SMS. That is, missing a tool to support the study selection process, allowing the collaboration between researchers by applying individual criteria and collective decision, supported by agreement or discussion and consensus. Solution: We developed the Porifera tool to fill this lack. IS Theory: Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and a Grounded Theory’s phase subset were used to evaluate Porifera’s tool quality. Methodology: Undergraduate and postgraduate students enrolled in the Experimental Software Engineering Research,used the Porifera tool and answered a post-used questionnaire with TAM’s sentences and other open questions. Then, a quantitative and qualitative analysis was performed. Summary of Results: It was possible to see high perceived usefulness and ease of use for Porifera. Too it noted the effectiveness of resources to support the collaborative activity and its contribution to learning and performing a collaborative SLR or SMS. The evaluation showed points to improve the Porifera’s interface. Contribution and Impact in the IS area: The Porifera is an IS for data, information, and knowledge research management because it gathers publications records and allows it will be interpreted and processed, making possible decisions making by researchers. The Porifera also allows performing an SLR or SMS with mobility, knowledge sharing, flexibility, and integration between people and technology.},

abstract = {The importance of experimentation for Software Engineering research has been notably established in the last years. The software engineering community has discussed how to proper report and evaluate experiments using different approaches, such as quality criteria, scales, and checklists. Nevertheless, there are no guidelines to support researchers and practitioners active in straightforward software engineering research areas, as in Software Product Lines (SPL), at conducting experiments. We hypothesize that experimentation guidelines may aid such a specific area by providing advice and actual excerpts reflecting good practices of SPL experimentation, thus experimentally evolving this area. Therefore, the goal of this paper is to provide guidelines for properly reporting and promoting SPL experiments. We defined such guidelines based on well-known software engineering experiment reports, quality evaluation checklists, and data extracted from 211 SPL experiments identified in a systematic mapping study. We evaluated the guidelines with a qualitative study with SPL and experimentation experts applying open and axial coding procedures. The evaluation enabled us to improve the guidelines. The resulting guidelines contain specific advice to researchers active in SPL and provide examples taken from published SPL experiments. The experts’ positive points indicate that the proposed guidelines can aid SPL researchers and practitioners. Sharing the resulting guidelines could support conducting SPL experiments and allow further area evolution based on prospective experiment replications and reproductions from well-designed and reported experiments.},

abstract = {Context: The lack of information in experiment reports impairs external replications and decreases experiment quality and reliability, causing a lack of knowledge dissemination and making it impossible to confirm the results, despite the existence of well-known guidelines for planning, conducting, and reporting experiments. Objective: Provide an in-depth study on how information from human-oriented controlled experiments in software engineering is reported after the emergence of supporting guidelines. Method: A systematic mapping study was conducted in the main empirical software engineering and software engineering venues, considering the period following the supporting guidelines publication. Results: We analyzed 412 articles from three conferences and three journals reporting experiments where we did not find crucial information about the experiments in most of them. Examples of such information are participant reward, target population, hypothesis, and conclusion and construct validity. Conclusion: There is a gap between the information the guidelines suggest reporting and what is reported. From 27 elements that should be on the reports, according to the guidelines, 65% of the analyzed articles failed to report at least 13 (almost half). Such finding opposes the natural intuition that with the appearance and maturation of guidelines, studies’ reports would increasingly comply with them over the years. As a consequence, a flawed report may raise doubts about the quality and validity of the study.},

abstract = {Requirements engineering (RE) is one of the most natural language-intensive fields within the software engineering area. Therefore, several works have been developed across the years to automate the analysis of natural language artifacts that are relevant for RE, including requirements documents, but also app reviews, privacy policies, and social media content related to software products. Furthermore, the recent diffusion of game-changing natural language processing (NLP) techniques and platforms has also boosted the interest of RE researchers. However, a reference framework to provide a holistic understanding of the field of NLP for RE is currently missing. Based on the results of a recent systematic mapping study, and stemming from a previous ICSE tutorial by one of the authors, this technical briefing gives an overview of NLP for RE tasks, available techniques, supporting tools and NLP technologies. It is oriented to both researchers and practitioners, and will gently guide the audience towards a clearer view of how NLP can empower RE, providing pointers to representative works and specialised tools.},

abstract = {The underlying principles of Sustainable Software Engineering are a core set of competencies Software Engineers need for defining, building, and running sustainable software applications. However, despite its importance, recently published studies have shown that Software Engineers have not reached a common and clear understanding of Sustainable Software Development (SSD). Consequently, it might be challenging to understand the value of the principles behind sustainability and how Software Engineers should apply them in practice. Therefore, the first step is to promote a field characterization to mitigate such effects to bridge such a gap. This paper reports on qualitative data analysis to leverage the sustainability principles through the support of the Grounded Theory method. We conducted this study using unstructured data retrieved from a systematic mapping study on sustainable software engineering and a survey applied in the software industry. To achieve the principles, we considered five critical dimensions: economic, social, individual, environmental, and technical. The key results are: (i) technical, environmental, and social concerns are present in all software development life-cycle (SDLC) phases; (ii) software engineers should consider sustainability requirements in the early SDLC phases; (iii) there is a need for stakeholder engagement focused on sustainability; (iv) software quality requirements support the development of sustainable software; and (v) sustainable concerns could generate trade-offs in the project. The yielded results might trigger further discussions around the SSD’s underlying principles and concepts and serve as a basis for the research community to identify models, techniques, and tools to support SSD.},

abstract = {AI-based systems are software systems with functionalities enabled by at least one AI component (e.g., for image-, speech-recognition, and autonomous driving). AI-based systems are becoming pervasive in society due to advances in AI. However, there is limited synthesized knowledge on Software Engineering (SE) approaches for building, operating, and maintaining AI-based systems. To collect and analyze state-of-the-art knowledge about SE for AI-based systems, we conducted a systematic mapping study. We considered 248 studies published between January 2010 and March 2020. SE for AI-based systems is an emerging research area, where more than 2/3 of the studies have been published since 2018. The most studied properties of AI-based systems are dependability and safety. We identified multiple SE approaches for AI-based systems, which we classified according to the SWEBOK areas. Studies related to software testing and software quality are very prevalent, while areas like software maintenance seem neglected. Data-related issues are the most recurrent challenges. Our results are valuable for: researchers, to quickly understand the state-of-the-art and learn which topics need more research; practitioners, to learn about the approaches and challenges that SE entails for AI-based systems; and, educators, to bridge the gap among SE and AI in their curricula.},

Till now, research papers are organized digitally as documents, mostly in PDF files. Not much effort is spent on effective knowledge classification, retrieval, storage, and representation. In contrast to the current paper-based approach for knowledge documentation, we present a statement-based approach, where each statement is linked to arguments and data of its evidence as well as to related statements. We argue that in this way, knowledge will be easier to retrieve, compare, and evaluate in contrast to current paper-based knowledge engineering in scientific search engines and digital libraries. Therefore, we present as a first step a novel multi-dimensional classification for statements in software engineering research. Statements are classified according to their research object, their kind (e.g., relevance), and their underlying evidence. This classification is validated and extended with a first systematic literature review. Additionally, we provide an example for illustration purpose.},

abstract = {Although testing effort estimation is a very important task in software project management, it is rarely described in the literature. There are many difficulties in finding any useful methods or tools for this purpose. Solutions to many other problems related to testing effort calculation are published much more often. There is also no research focusing on both testing effort estimation and all related areas of software engineering. To fill this gap, we performed a systematic literature review on both questions. Although our primary objective was to find some tools or implementable metods for test effort estimation, we have quickly discovered many other interesting topics related to the main one. The main contribution of this work is the presentation of the testing effort estimation task in a very wide context, indicating the relations with other research fields. This systematic literature review presents a detailed overview of testing effort estimation task, including challenges and approaches to automating it and the solutions proposed in the literature. It also exhaustively investigates related research topics, classifying publications that can be found in connection to the testing effort according to seven criteria formulated on the basis of our research questions. We present here both synthesis of our finding and the deep analysis of the stated research problems.},

abstract = {Context: The concept of software craftsmanship has early roots in computing, and in 2009, the Manifesto for Software Craftsmanship was formulated as a reaction to how the Agile methods were practiced and taught. But software craftsmanship has seldom been studied from a software engineering perspective.Objective: The objective of this article is to systematize an anatomy of software craftsmanship through literature studies and a longitudinal case study.Method: We performed a snowballing literature review based on an initial set of nine papers, resulting in&nbsp;18 papers and 11 books. We also performed a case study following seven years of software development of a product for the financial market, eliciting qualitative, and quantitative results. We used thematic coding to synthesize the results into categories.Results: The resulting anatomy is centered around four themes, containing 17 principles and 47 hierarchical practices connected to the principles. We present the identified practices based on the experiences gathered from the case study, triangulating with the literature results.Conclusion: We provide our systematically derived anatomy of software craftsmanship with the goal of inspiring more research into the principles and practices of software craftsmanship and how these relate to other principles within software engineering in general.},

abstract = {Many practitioners and researchers still consider software as program code, composed by algorithms and associated documentation, written in a programming language, and finally compiled or interpreted in a computational environment. The different facets of the software question, explored in interdisciplinary fields such as Digital Humanities, seem largely unexplored in Software Engineering and other traditional Computing fields of research. This paper aims to present an overview of ethical aspects through the publications of the Brazilian Symposium on Software Quality (SBQS). We followed a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) approach and presented quantitative and qualitative, and in-depth results, analyzing fifteen editions of the SBQS between 2006 and 2020. We adopted the concept of Ethics in a primary way, through searches for terms directly associated, and secondary, by terms such as Informed Consent, aligned with the definitions and concepts of Computational Ethics combined with episteme and good practices in Software Engineering. The results pointed to the minor occurrence of ethical aspects in SBQS publications, growing timidly over the years. We conclude that there is broad space to explore the theme of Computational Ethics combined with Software Quality.},

abstract = {Software development is a collaborative task and, hence, involves different persons. Research has shown the relevance of social aspects in the development team for a successful and satisfying project closure. Especially the mood of a team has been proven to be of particular importance. Thus, project managers or project leaders want to be aware of situations in which negative mood is present to allow for interventions. So-called sentiment analysis tools offer a way to determine the mood based on text-based communication. In this paper, we present the results of a systematic literature review of sentiment analysis tools developed for or applied in the context of software engineering. Our results summarize insights from 80 papers with respect to (1) the application domain, (2) the purpose, (3) the used data sets, (4) the approaches for developing sentiment analysis tools and (5) the difficulties researchers face when applying sentiment analysis in the context of software projects. According to our results, sentiment analysis is frequently applied to open-source software projects, and most tools are based on support-vector machines. Despite the frequent use of sentiment analysis in software engineering, there are open issues, e.g., regarding the identification of irony or sarcasm, pointing to future research directions.},

Managers, leaders, and academics need to know the human factors influencing the individuals, the development team, and the software project activities. Despite the increasing number of secondary studies about human factors in Software Engineering (SE) and in Agile Software Development (ASD), there is no study synthesizing which human factors influence software development without a specific perspective from SE or human factor thematic. Objective: We aim to summarise human factors and their influence on SE development teams and ASD teams. Method: We executed a tertiary study. We used thematic analysis to examine the resulting data. Results: We found 29 systematic literature reviews and systematic mapping studies addressing the human perspective in SE teams. We identified 101 human factors and 79 influences grouped in 4 categories (Team member, Team, Project, and Organization). Also, we identified 71 human factors and 60 influences on ASD. The most investigated human factors are Communication, Collaboration, Knowledge, and Motivation. Conclusions: The identified human factors and their influences can be considered most significant by software organizations, researchers, and academics in SE practices. Based on our results, practitioners might propose activities that enhance human capital behaviors that influence individual motivation, agile mindset, team climate, software quality, or agile transition in traditional organizations.},

Technologies, such as those found in mobile devices, are very attractive to people with ASD and can be used as a valuable educational tool for these individuals. The aim of this study was to learn about how mobile apps aimed at people with ASD are developed and evaluated, carried out through a systematic mapping of applications aimed at people with ASD, in order to better understand their foundations, motivations, evaluation mode, resources and user profile. The results indicated that the main procedures used to support the applications for people with ASD are the questionnaires to identify the ASD, such as the CHAT and AQ-10, and the ABA intervention, and that these applications, mostly, seek to identify the ASD in a practical way and at a low cost. Most of the apps were evaluated by usability testing and through indirect observation through the app's logs. The most used hardware and software resources are the mobile device camera and convolutional neural networks (CNN), respectively, with most applications aimed at children and the most common software engineering methodologies were requirements analysis and prototyping.},

abstract = {The adoption of Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) is usually only based on its theoretical benefits instead of empirical evidences. In fact, there is no work that synthesizes the empirical studies on SPLE. This makes it difficult for researchers to base their contributions on previous works validated with an empirical strategy. The objective of this work is to discover and summarize the studies that have used empirical evidences in SPLE limited to those ones with the intervention of humans. This will allow evaluating the quality and knowing the scope of these studies over time. Doing so, research opportunities can arise. Analyzing the authors and institutions that investigate SPLE supported by empirical studies will also help to know which institutions have knowledge of the subject, leading to detect and encourage collaboration among researches. A systematic literature review was conducted with the focus on those studies in which there is human intervention and were published between 2000 and 2018 (the systematic literature review was developed in 2019). We considered peer-reviewed papers from journals and top software engineering conferences. Out of a total of 1880 studies in the initial set, a total of 62 primary studies were selected after applying a series of inclusion and exclusion criteria. We found that, approximately 56% of the studies used the empirical case study strategy while the rest used experimental strategies. Around 86% of the case studies were performed in an industrial environment showing the penetration of SPLE in industry while 81% of the experiments were conducted in an academic environment. Around 95.16% of the studies address aspects related to domain engineering while application engineering received less attention. Most of the experiments and case study evaluated showed an acceptable level of quality. The first study found dates from 2005 and since 2008, the interest in the empirical SPLE has increased.},

abstract = {Good comments are invaluable assets to software projects, as they help developers understand and maintain projects. However, due to some poor commenting practices, comments are often missing or inconsistent with the source code. Software engineering practitioners often spend a significant amount of time and effort reading and understanding programs without or with poor comments. To counter this, researchers have proposed various techniques to automatically generate code comments in recent years, which can not only save developers time writing comments but also help them better understand existing software projects. However, it is unclear whether these techniques can alleviate comment issues and whether practitioners appreciate this line of research. To fill this gap, we performed an empirical study by interviewing and surveying practitioners about their expectations of research in code comment generation. We then compared what practitioners need and the current state-of-the-art research by performing a literature review of papers on code comment generation techniques published in the premier publication venues from 2010 to 2020. From this comparison, we highlighted the directions where researchers need to put effort to develop comment generation techniques that matter to practitioners.},

abstract = {An increasingly popular set of techniques adopted by software engineering (SE) researchers to automate development tasks are those rooted in the concept of Deep Learning (DL). The popularity of such techniques largely stems from their automated feature engineering capabilities, which aid in modeling software artifacts. However, due to the rapid pace at which DL techniques have been adopted, it is difficult to distill the current successes, failures, and opportunities of the current research landscape. In an effort to bring clarity to this cross-cutting area of work, from its modern inception to the present, this article presents a systematic literature review of research at the intersection of SE &amp; DL. The review canvasses work appearing in the most prominent SE and DL conferences and journals and spans 128 papers across 23&nbsp;unique SE tasks. We center our analysis around the components of learning, a set of principles that governs the application of machine learning techniques (ML) to a given problem domain, discussing several aspects of the surveyed work at a granular level. The end result of our analysis is a research roadmap that both delineates the foundations of DL techniques applied to SE research and highlights likely areas of fertile exploration for the future.},

It is important to systematically review and synthesize the ML-based data exfiltration countermeasures for building a body of knowledge on this important topic. Objective: This article aims at systematically reviewing ML-based data exfiltration countermeasures to identify and classify ML approaches, feature engineering techniques, evaluation datasets, and performance metrics used for these countermeasures. This review also aims at identifying gaps in research on ML-based data exfiltration countermeasures. Method: We used Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method to select and review 92 papers. Results: The review has enabled us to: (a) classify the ML approaches used in the countermeasures into data-driven, and behavior-driven approaches; (b) categorize features into six types: behavioral, content-based, statistical, syntactical, spatial, and temporal; (c) classify the evaluation datasets into simulated, synthesized, and real datasets; and (d) identify 11 performance measures used by these studies. Conclusion: We conclude that: (i) The integration of data-driven and behavior-driven approaches should be explored; (ii) There is a need of developing high quality and large size evaluation datasets; (iii) Incremental ML model training should be incorporated in countermeasures; (iv) Resilience to adversarial learning should be considered and explored during the development of countermeasures to avoid poisoning attacks; and (v) The use of automated feature engineering should be encouraged for efficiently detecting data exfiltration attacks.},

abstract = {Recently, Agile Development has emerged as an alternative approach in software engineering. The Agile Software Development (ASD) process provides the ability to cope with ever-changing requirements. On the other hand, the Capability Maturity Model Integration, one of the Software Process Improvement Framework, is widely used to provide software development organizations with structure and stability in their software process. It enables organizations to generate software processes with better quality software, the productivity increase of the development team, and minimal risk of failure. The idea behind combining the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) and Agile aims to create a software development procedure that is stable and continues to improve while also providing agility for dealing with dynamic business needs. This research compiles the experiences of combining both software and identifies challenges for the collaborative implementation process. This study also highlights the extent of the compatibility of CMMI and Agile Development. This research followed a standardized Systematic Literature Review procedure and used the approach known as Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses or PRISMA. The findings indicate that the main challenges with regard to combining CMMI and Agile are the lack of relevant knowledge and experience and the culture of CMMI, Agile, or sometimes both. The limited scope of Agile itself poses another considerable challenge. Agile focuses on software development projects, while CMMI has a broader range, from project-level development to organization-level process improvement. This review also finds that Agile Development is compatible with CMMI at a maturity level of 2 and 3. Future studies should determine the optimal method for overcoming the obstacles associated with combining CMMI and Agile.},

abstract = {A significant part of Software Engineering students’ academic and professional life involves working on projects in collaboration with their peers. They will form teams and perform on many software-related projects. Studies based on a systematic literature review and experimental results in a multidisciplinary tech-based innovation course with undergraduate students from Computer Engineering and Computer Science indicate difficulties in two significant activities in collaborative work: decision-making and reaching consensus. These recurrent difficulties negatively affect learners’ motivation and engagement throughout the project’s life cycle, besides other losses. This article aims to present a tool based on a model called MO-DM (Motivation-Oriented Decision-Making) proposed in doctoral research to address these hardships. It enables a new project view of members’ motivation and engagement, considering all the choices made along the project journey. The tool is grounded on EVC (Expectancy-Value-Cost) model, using it in a new way. Decisions like ”What programming language should we use?” are observed from the perspective of ”Which programming language can bring more engagement and motivation to the majority of the team?”. This view makes it possible to identify which students are more susceptible to being demotivated and disengaged in each step, and actions can be performed to mitigate these effects. Teams can make more engaging and motivating choices by picking the ones that will positively affect most of the group, enhancing the chances of successful projects. MO-DM tool is under preliminary tests with satisfactory results. Many decision-making situations where motivation and engagement are concerns can benefit from MO-DM.

abstract = {Context: Deep learning (DL) techniques have gained significant popularity among software engineering (SE) researchers in recent years. This is because they can often solve many SE challenges without enormous manual feature engineering effort and complex domain knowledge.Objective: Although many DL studies have reported substantial advantages over other state-of-the-art models on effectiveness, they often ignore two factors: (1) reproducibility—whether the reported experimental results can be obtained by other researchers using authors’ artifacts (i.e., source code and datasets) with the same experimental setup; and (2) replicability—whether the reported experimental result can be obtained by other researchers using their re-implemented artifacts with a different experimental setup. We observed that DL studies commonly overlook these two factors and declare them as minor threats or leave them for future work. This is mainly due to high model complexity with many manually set parameters and the time-consuming optimization process, unlike classical supervised machine learning (ML) methods (e.g., random forest). This study aims to investigate the urgency and importance of reproducibility and replicability for DL studies on SE tasks.Method: In this study, we conducted a literature review on 147 DL studies recently published in 20 SE venues and 20 AI (Artificial Intelligence) venues to investigate these issues. We also re-ran four representative DL models in SE to investigate important factors that may strongly affect the reproducibility and replicability of a study.Results: Our statistics show the urgency of investigating these two factors in SE, where only 10.2% of the studies investigate any research question to show that their models can address at least one issue of replicability and/or reproducibility. More than 62.6% of the studies do not even share high-quality source code or complete data to support the reproducibility of their complex models. Meanwhile, our experimental results show the importance of reproducibility and replicability, where the reported performance of a DL model could not be reproduced for an unstable optimization process. Replicability could be substantially compromised if the model training is not convergent, or if performance is sensitive to the size of vocabulary and testing data.Conclusion: It is urgent for the SE community to provide a long-lasting link to a high-quality reproduction package, enhance DL-based solution stability and convergence, and avoid performance sensitivity on different sampled data.},

abstract = {Natural Language Processing for Requirements Engineering (NLP4RE) is an area of research and development that seeks to apply natural language processing (NLP) techniques, tools, and resources to the requirements engineering (RE) process, to support human analysts to carry out various linguistic analysis tasks on textual requirements documents, such as detecting language issues, identifying key domain concepts, and establishing requirements traceability links. This article reports on a mapping study that surveys the landscape of NLP4RE research to provide a holistic understanding of the field. Following the guidance of systematic review, the mapping study is directed by five research questions, cutting across five aspects of NLP4RE research, concerning the state of the literature, the state of empirical research, the research focus, the state of tool development, and the usage of NLP technologies. Our main results are as follows: (i) we identify a total of 404 primary studies relevant to NLP4RE, which were published over the past 36 years and from 170 different venues; (ii) most of these studies (67.08%) are solution proposals, assessed by a laboratory experiment or an example application, while only a small percentage (7%) are assessed in industrial settings; (iii) a large proportion of the studies (42.70%) focus on the requirements analysis phase, with quality defect detection as their central task and requirements specification as their commonly processed document type; (iv) 130 NLP4RE tools (i.e., RE specific NLP tools) are extracted from these studies, but only 17 of them (13.08%) are available for download; (v) 231 different NLP technologies are also identified, comprising 140 NLP techniques, 66 NLP tools, and 25 NLP resources, but most of them—particularly those novel NLP techniques and specialized tools—are used infrequently; by contrast, commonly used NLP technologies are traditional analysis techniques (e.g., POS tagging and tokenization), general-purpose tools (e.g., Stanford CoreNLP and GATE) and generic language lexicons (WordNet and British National Corpus). The mapping study not only provides a collection of the literature in NLP4RE but also, more importantly, establishes a structure to frame the existing literature&nbsp;through categorization, synthesis and conceptualization of the main theoretical concepts and relationships that encompass&nbsp;both RE and NLP aspects. Our work thus produces a conceptual framework of NLP4RE. The framework is used to identify research gaps and directions, highlight technology transfer needs, and encourage more synergies between the RE community, the NLP one, and the software&nbsp;and systems&nbsp;practitioners. Our results can be used as a starting point to frame future studies according to a well-defined terminology and can be expanded as new technologies and novel solutions emerge.},

abstract = {AI-based systems are software systems with functionalities enabled by at least one AI component (e.g., for image-, speech-recognition, and autonomous driving). AI-based systems are becoming pervasive in society due to advances in AI. However, there is limited synthesized knowledge on Software Engineering (SE) approaches for building, operating, and maintaining AI-based systems. To collect and analyze state-of-the-art knowledge about SE for AI-based systems, we conducted a systematic mapping study. We considered 248 studies published between January 2010 and March 2020. SE for AI-based systems is an emerging research area, where more than 2/3 of the studies have been published since 2018. The most studied properties of AI-based systems are dependability and safety. We identified multiple SE approaches for AI-based systems, which we classified according to the SWEBOK areas. Studies related to software testing and software quality are very prevalent, while areas like software maintenance seem neglected. Data-related issues are the most recurrent challenges. Our results are valuable for: researchers, to quickly understand the state-of-the-art and learn which topics need more research; practitioners, to learn about the approaches and challenges that SE entails for AI-based systems; and, educators, to bridge the gap among SE and AI in their curricula.},

abstract = {Context: The lack of information in experiment reports impairs external replications and decreases experiment quality and reliability, causing a lack of knowledge dissemination and making it impossible to confirm the results, despite the existence of well-known guidelines for planning, conducting, and reporting experiments. Objective: Provide an in-depth study on how information from human-oriented controlled experiments in software engineering is reported after the emergence of supporting guidelines. Method: A systematic mapping study was conducted in the main empirical software engineering and software engineering venues, considering the period following the supporting guidelines publication. Results: We analyzed 412 articles from three conferences and three journals reporting experiments where we did not find crucial information about the experiments in most of them. Examples of such information are participant reward, target population, hypothesis, and conclusion and construct validity. Conclusion: There is a gap between the information the guidelines suggest reporting and what is reported. From 27 elements that should be on the reports, according to the guidelines, 65% of the analyzed articles failed to report at least 13 (almost half). Such finding opposes the natural intuition that with the appearance and maturation of guidelines, studies’ reports would increasingly comply with them over the years. As a consequence, a flawed report may raise doubts about the quality and validity of the study.},

abstract = {Various new technologies have developed as software security solutions have become more critical. One of the essential parts of software quality is the product's security. Though providing examples covering all phases of secure software development is necessary, very few of these situations have been documented. More than a few approaches have been proposed and implemented to handle software security, but only a few of them provide valid evidence for developing secure software applications. This paper presents the results of a Systematic Mapping Study (SMS), which was carried out to determine the existence of software security metrics, tools, standards, and security-related research topics mainly discussed and addressed. A total of 116 studies were chosen for inclusion in this review. Selected studies led us to discover 55 Secure Software Engineering (SSE) metrics, 68 SSE tools, 33 SSE standards, and 12 SSE research topics that have been discussed and addressed. This effort will aid software development firms in better understanding existing security measures employed in creating secure software. It can also serve as a foundation for researchers to build and create new software security solutions and identify new research directions.},

abstract = {An increasingly popular set of techniques adopted by software engineering (SE) researchers to automate development tasks are those rooted in the concept of Deep Learning (DL). The popularity of such techniques largely stems from their automated feature engineering capabilities, which aid in modeling software artifacts. However, due to the rapid pace at which DL techniques have been adopted, it is difficult to distill the current successes, failures, and opportunities of the current research landscape. In an effort to bring clarity to this cross-cutting area of work, from its modern inception to the present, this article presents a systematic literature review of research at the intersection of SE &amp; DL. The review canvasses work appearing in the most prominent SE and DL conferences and journals and spans 128 papers across 23&nbsp;unique SE tasks. We center our analysis around the components of learning, a set of principles that governs the application of machine learning techniques (ML) to a given problem domain, discussing several aspects of the surveyed work at a granular level. The end result of our analysis is a research roadmap that both delineates the foundations of DL techniques applied to SE research and highlights likely areas of fertile exploration for the future.},

The different facets of the software question, explored in interdisciplinary fields such as Digital Humanities, seem largely unexplored in Software Engineering and other traditional Computing fields of research. This paper aims to present an overview of ethical aspects through the publications of the Brazilian Symposium on Software Quality (SBQS). We followed a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) approach and presented quantitative and qualitative, and in-depth results, analyzing fifteen editions of the SBQS between 2006 and 2020. We adopted the concept of Ethics in a primary way, through searches for terms directly associated, and secondary, by terms such as Informed Consent, aligned with the definitions and concepts of Computational Ethics combined with episteme and good practices in Software Engineering. The results pointed to the minor occurrence of ethical aspects in SBQS publications, growing timidly over the years. We conclude that there is broad space to explore the theme of Computational Ethics combined with Software Quality.},

abstract = {Context: Crowdsourcing software development (CSSD) is a form of collective intelligence that is gaining attention in the Information Technology industry as a work alternative for software projects. CSSD represents a paradigm shift in the in-house development approach, promising deliveries with quality, productivity and innovation. Problem: CSSD is an emerging approach, both in research and in practice. Despite the existence of commercial supporting platforms, organizations of different sizes still face the challenge of how to organize the collective work, and a clear definition of how to perform CSSD is not known yet. Solution: This article presents an analysis of the literature to identify the main processes, practices, tools and platforms used in CSSD initiatives, and to understand the benefits and challenges reported in these initiatives as well. IS theory: Not applicable. Method: Descriptive research based on systematic literature mapping. Summary of Results: CSSD is understood as a democratic alternative with great potential for improving quality, productivity and innovation in software projects. However, challenges for its realization are many and of different kinds (technical, managerial, methodological and legal). Results also show not a large amount of CSSD case study reports in real situations. Contributions and Impact on the IS area: This work provides an overview of CSSD application, as well as a critical analysis of its advantages and challenges, contributing with discussions to the challenge of Information Systems and the Open World. This overview enables reflection on the adoption of CSSD, stimulating the research of solutions under development by crowds for companies of different sizes.},

abstract = {Software development is a collaborative task and, hence, involves different persons. Research has shown the relevance of social aspects in the development team for a successful and satisfying project closure. Especially the mood of a team has been proven to be of particular importance. Thus, project managers or project leaders want to be aware of situations in which negative mood is present to allow for interventions. So-called sentiment analysis tools offer a way to determine the mood based on text-based communication. In this paper, we present the results of a systematic literature review of sentiment analysis tools developed for or applied in the context of software engineering. Our results summarize insights from 80 papers with respect to (1) the application domain, (2) the purpose, (3) the used data sets, (4) the approaches for developing sentiment analysis tools and (5) the difficulties researchers face when applying sentiment analysis in the context of software projects. According to our results, sentiment analysis is frequently applied to open-source software projects, and most tools are based on support-vector machines. Despite the frequent use of sentiment analysis in software engineering, there are open issues, e.g., regarding the identification of irony or sarcasm, pointing to future research directions.},

Despite the growing interest in MLR-based studies, the literature assessing how GL has contributed to MLR studies is still scarce. Objective: This research aims to assess how the use of GL contributed to MLR studies. By contributing, we mean, understanding to what extent GL is providing evidence that is indeed used by an MLR to answer its research question. Method: We start by conducting a tertiary study to identify MLR studies published between 2017 and 2019, selecting nine of them. We then identified the GL used in these studies and assessed to what extent the GLs are providing evidence that help these studies to answer their research questions. Results: Our analysis identified that 1) GL provided evidence not found in TL, 2) most of the GL sources were used to provide recommendations to solve problems, explain a topic, and classify the findings, and 3) 19 different GL types were used in the studies; these GLs were mainly produced by SE practitioners (including blog posts, slides presentations, or project descriptions). Conclusions: We evidence how GL contributed to MLR studies. We observed that if these GLs were not included in the MLR, several findings would have been omitted or weakened. We also described the challenges involved when conducting this investigation, along with potential ways to deal with them, which may help future SE researchers.},

abstract = {Considering the critical role of software in modern societies, we face an urgent need to educate more competent software professionals. Software engineering competencies (SEC) are considered the backbone of successfully developing software products. Consequently, SEC has become a hotspot for software engineering research and practice. Although scientific literature on SEC is not lacking, to our knowledge, a comprehensive overview of the current state of SEC research is missing. To that end, we conducted an extensive and systematic review of the SEC literature. We provide an overview of the current state of research on SEC, with a particular focus on common SEC research areas. In addition to reporting the available SEC models and frameworks, we compile a list of 49 unique essential competencies of software professionals. Finally, we highlight several gaps in the literature that deserve further research. In particular, we call for a better understanding of how the essential competencies of software professionals change over time, as well as fresh accounts of the essential competencies of software professionals. Additionally, considering recent shifts toward Agile and DevOps methods, future research must explore the competencies required for developing software products in modern development environments.}

abstract = {Context: Predicting software project effort from Use Case Points (UCP) method is increasingly used among researchers and practitioners. However, unlike other effort estimation domains, this area of interest has not been systematically reviewed. Aims: There is a need for a systemic literature review to provide directions and supports for this research area of effort estimation. Specifically, the objective of this study is twofold: 1) to classify UCP effort estimation papers based on four criteria: contribution type, research approach, dataset type and techniques used with UCP; and 2) to analyze these paper from different views: estimation accuracy, favorable estimation context and impact of combined techniques on the accuracy of UCP. Method: We used the systematic literature review methodology proposed by Kitchenham and Charters. This includes searching for the most relevant papers, selecting quality papers, extracting data and drawing results. Result: The authors of UCP research paper, are generally not aware of previous published results and conclusions in the field of UCP effort estimation. There is a lack of UCP related publications in the top software engineering journals. This makes a conclusion that such papers are not useful for the community. Furthermore, most articles used small numbers of projects which cannot support generalizing the conclusion in most cases. Conclusions: There are multiple research directions for UCP method that have not been examined so far such as validating the algebraic construction of UCP based on industrial data. Also, there is a need for standard automated tools that govern the process of translating use case diagram into its corresponding UCP metrics. Although there is an increase interest among researchers to collect industrial data and build effort prediction models based on machine learning methods, the quality of data is still subject to debate.}

Software companies need to manage and refactor Technical Debt issues. Therefore, it is necessary to understand if and when refactoring of Technical Debt should be prioritized with respect to developing features or fixing bugs.
Objective
The goal of this study is to investigate the existing body of knowledge in software engineering to understand what Technical Debt prioritization approaches have been proposed in research and industry.
Method
We conducted a Systematic Literature Review of 557 unique papers published until 2020, following a consolidated methodology applied in software engineering. We included 44 primary studies.
Results
Different approaches have been proposed for Technical Debt prioritization, all having different goals and proposing optimization regarding different criteria. The proposed measures capture only a small part of the plethora of factors used to prioritize Technical Debt qualitatively in practice. We present an impact map of such factors. However, there is a lack of empirical and validated set of tools.
Conclusion
We observed that Technical Debt prioritization research is preliminary and there is no consensus on what the important factors are and how to measure them. Consequently, we cannot consider current research conclusive. In this paper, we therefore outline different directions for necessary future investigations.}

To address this need, we identify, analyse, and classify the state-of-the-art in the field of mobile apps’ reliability through a systematic mapping study. From the results of such a study, researchers in the field can identify pressing research gaps, and developers can gain knowledge about existing solutions, to potentially leverage them in practice. We found 87 relevant papers which were then analysed and classified based on their research focus, research type, contribution, research method, study settings, data, quality attributes and metrics used. Results indicate that there is a lack of research on understanding reliability with regard to context-awareness, self-healing, ageing and rejuvenation, and runtime event handling. These aspects have rarely been studied, or if studied, there is limited evaluation. We also identified several other research gaps including the need to conduct more research in real-world industrial projects. Furthermore, little attention has been paid towards quality standards while conducting research. Outcomes here show numerous opportunities for greater research depth and breadth on mobile app reliability.}

Grey Literature (GL) recently has grown in Software Engineering (SE) research since the increased use of online communication channels by software engineers. However, there is still a limited understanding of how SE research is taking advantage of GL.
Objective:
This research aimed to understand how SE researchers use GL in their secondary studies.
Methods:
We conducted a tertiary study of studies published between 2011 and 2018 in high-quality software engineering conferences and journals. We then applied qualitative and quantitative analysis to investigate 446 potential studies.
Results:
From the 446 selected studies, 126 studies cited GL but only 95 of those used GL to answer a specific research question representing almost 21% of all the 446 secondary studies. Interestingly, we identified that few studies employed specific search mechanisms and used additional criteria for assessing GL. Moreover, by the time we conducted this research, 49% of the GL URLs are not working anymore. Based on our findings, we discuss some challenges in using GL and potential mitigation plans.
Conclusion:
In this paper, we summarized the last 10 years of software engineering research that uses GL, showing that GL has been essential for bringing practical new perspectives that are scarce in traditional literature. By drawing the current landscape of use, we also raise some awareness of related challenges (and strategies to deal with them).}

abstract = {Context
Developing high-quality software requires skilled software professionals equipped with a set of basic and essential software engineering competencies (SEC). These competencies and the satisfaction levels derived from them change over a project's lifecycle, or as software professionals move from one project to another.
Objective
Previous studies suggest a lack of means enabling SEC stakeholders to identify and assess competencies suitable for different projects. Additionally, previous research has mainly portrayed SEC to be static and overlooked their evolution over time and across projects. We investigate how we could effectively identify and match the competencies of software professionals necessary for different projects.
Method
We follow a mixed-method approach to iteratively develop and evaluate a framework for identifying and managing SEC. In so doing, we use the results of an extensive literature review, focus group discussions with experts from academia and industry, and data collected through interviews with 138 individuals with a supervisory role in the software industry.
Results
Drawing on the Kano model and Competency Framework for Software Engineers, we propose a Unified Competence Gate for Software Professionals (UComGSP), a framework for identifying and managing SEC. The UComGSP consists of 62 hard competencies, 63 soft competencies, and 25 essential SEC competencies. Additionally, we propose three stakeholders’ satisfaction levels for SEC assessment: basic, performance, and delighter. Furthermore, based on empirical observation, we report 27 competencies not mentioned in the reviewed literature; 11 of them are considered essential competencies.
Conclusion
Competence development involves different stakeholders, including software professionals, educators, and the software industry. The UComGSP framework enables SEC stakeholders to (i) identify SE competencies, (ii) identify the essential SEC, and (iii) assess the satisfaction levels that can be derived from different competencies. Future research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework across software development projects.}

Predictive maintenance is a technique for creating a more sustainable, safe, and profitable industry. One of the key challenges for creating predictive maintenance systems is the lack of failure data, as the machine is frequently repaired before failure. Digital Twins provide a real-time representation of the physical machine and generate data, such as asset degradation, which the predictive maintenance algorithm can use. Since 2018, scientific literature on the utilization of Digital Twins for predictive maintenance has accelerated, indicating the need for a thorough review.
Objective
This research aims to gather and synthesize the studies that focus on predictive maintenance using Digital Twins to pave the way for further research.
Method
A systematic literature review (SLR) using an active learning tool is conducted on published primary studies on predictive maintenance using Digital Twins, in which 42 primary studies have been analyzed.
Results
This SLR identifies several aspects of predictive maintenance using Digital Twins, including the objectives, application domains, Digital Twin platforms, Digital Twin representation types, approaches, abstraction levels, design patterns, communication protocols, twinning parameters, and challenges and solution directions. These results contribute to a Software Engineering approach for developing predictive maintenance using Digital Twins in academics and the industry.
Conclusion
This study is the first SLR in predictive maintenance using Digital Twins. We answer key questions for designing a successful predictive maintenance model leveraging Digital Twins. We found that to this day, computational burden, data variety, and complexity of models, assets, or components are the key challenges in designing these models.}

Systems exhibiting anticipatory behavior are controlling devices that are influencing decisions critical to business with increasing frequency, but testing such systems has received little attention from the artificial intelligence or software engineering communities.
Goal:
In this article, we describe research activities being carried out to test anticipatory systems and explore how this research contributes to the body of knowledge. In addition, we review the types of addressed anticipatory applications and point out open issues and trends.
Method:
This systematic mapping study was conducted to classify and analyze the literature on testing anticipatory systems, enabling us to highlight the most relevant topics and potential gaps in this field.
Results:
We identified 206 studies that contribute to the testing of systems that exhibit anticipatory behavior. The papers address testing at stages such as context sensing, inferring higher-level concepts from the sensed data, predicting the future context, and intelligent decision-making. We also identified agent testing as a trend, among others.
Conclusion:
The existing literature on testing anticipatory systems has originated from various research communities, such as those on autonomous agents and quality engineering. Although researchers have recently exhibited increasing interest in testing anticipatory systems, theoretical knowledge about testing such systems is lacking.}

In this study, to overcome these potential shortcomings, we performed a systematic literature review on user interests identification. We used as input data browsing tab titles. Our goal here is to offer a service to the readership, which is capable of systematically guiding and reliably orienting researchers, developers, and users in this very vast domain.

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of Internet-enabled devices that can make different operations, like sensing, communicating, and reacting to changes arising in the surrounding environment. Nowadays, the number of IoT devices is already higher than the world population. These devices operate by exchanging data between them, sometimes through an intermediate cloud infrastructure, and may be used to enable a wide variety of novel services that can potentially improve the quality of life of billions of people. Nonetheless, all that glitters is not gold: the increasing adoption of IoT comes with several privacy concerns due to the lack or loss of control over the sensitive data exchanged by these devices. This represents a key challenge for software engineering researchers attempting to address those privacy concerns by proposing (semi-)automated solutions to identify sources of privacy leaks. In this respect, a notable trend is represented by the adoption of smart solutions, that is, the definition of techniques based on artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. This paper proposes a systematic literature review of the research in smart detection of privacy concerns in IoT devices. Following well-established guidelines, we identify 152 primary studies that we analyze under three main perspectives: (1) What are the privacy concerns addressed with AI-enabled techniques; (2) What are the algorithms employed and how they have been configured/validated; and (3) Which are the domains targeted by these techniques. The key results of the study identified six main tasks targeted through the use of artificial intelligence, like Malware Detection or Network Analysis. Support Vector Machine is the technique most frequently used in literature, however in many cases researchers do not explicitly indicate the domain where to use artificial intelligence algorithms. We conclude the paper by distilling several lessons learned and implications for software engineering researchers.}

A number of researchers in Software Engineering (SE) have developed a variety of QA instruments and also reported their challenges. We previously conducted a tertiary study on SLRs with QA from 2004 to 2013, and reported the findings in 2015. Objective: With the widespread use of SLRs in SE and the increasing adoption of QA in these SLRs in recent years, it is necessary to empirically investigate whether the previous conclusions are still valid and whether there are new insights to the subject in question using a larger and a more up-to-date SLR set. More importantly, we aim to depict a clear picture of QA used in SLRs in SE by aggregating and distilling good practices, including the commonly used QA instruments as well as the major roles and aspects of QA in research. Method: An extended tertiary study was conducted with the newly collected SLRs from 2014 to 2018 and the original SLRs from 2004 to 2013 to systematically review the QA used by SLRs in SE during the 15-year period from 2004 to 2018. In addition, this extended study also compared and contrasted the findings of the previous study conducted in 2015. Results: A total of 241 SLRs between 2004 and 2018 were included, from which we identified a number of QA instruments. These instruments are generally designed to focus on the rationality of study design, the rigor of study execution and analysis, and the credibility and contribution of study findings and conclusions, with the emphasis largely placed on its rigor. The quality data is mainly used for literature selection or as evidence to support conclusions. Conclusions: QA has received much attention in SE in more recent years and the improvement is evident since the last study in 2015. New findings show that the aims are more concise, the instruments are more diverse and rigorous, and the criteria are more thoughtful.}

Our objective is to identify and classify the aspect-oriented software development methodologies used to reduce the effort and costs of moving from traditional approaches to the aspect-oriented approach in real-world settings. We conducted a systematic mapping study (SMS). Our search strategies retrieved a set of 3212 papers out of which 115 were selected as relevant studies. We defined eight categories to classify these studies: aspect-oriented methodologies proposed for early aspects; development early phases covered; notations; modeling techniques; supporting tools; aspect-oriented methodologies used in real-world settings; benefits reported and unsolved issues. As a result, 39 named methodologies were reported; they cover the business modeling (14 papers), requirements (93 papers), test cases (1 paper) and design (41 papers) phases of the software development life cycle (SDLC); we found 36 different notations, with UML as the most mentioned (66 papers); 22 modeling techniques were found, where the use cases were the ones that appeared the most, on 43 occasions; 43 support tools of which none was repeated in more than 3 articles; 15 applications in real-world settings; 17 benefits, modularization being the most mentioned with 4 occurrences; and 15 pending improvement opportunities. Finally, we have obtained conclusions: the literature analyzed demonstrates that there are no prevailing standards on methodologies and notations, beyond that the most employed are those belonging to the OMG; we have not found any methodology that includes all phases of the SDLC; the diagrams corresponding to OMG’s standards account for 78% of the results in the facet of modeling techniques; there are no tools that have the greatest predilection and the most used is mentioned only three times; in addition, 41% of the articles do not mention any tool; the evidence of aspect-oriented methodologies application in real-world settings reached just the 10%, although the declared benefits are coincident with those promised in the aspect-orientated literature.

One tedious work in literature reviews is to find relevant studies amongst thousands of non-relevant search results. In theory, expert systems can assist in finding relevant work but those systems have primarily been tested in simulations rather than in application to actual literature reviews. Hence, few researchers have faith in such expert systems. Accordingly, using a realistic case study, this paper assesses how well our state-of-the-art expert system can help with literature reviews. The assessed literature review aimed at identifying test case prioritization techniques for automated UI testing, specifically from 8,349 papers on IEEE Xplore. This corpus was studied with an expert system that incorporates an incrementally updated human-in-the-loop active learning tool. Using that expert system, in three hours, we found 242 relevant papers from which we identified 12 techniques representing the state-of-the-art in test case prioritization when source code information is not available. These results were then validated by six other graduate students manually exploring the same corpus. Without the expert system, this task would have required 53 h and would have found 27 additional papers. That is, our expert system achieved 90% recall with 6% of the human effort cost when compared to a conventional manual method. Significantly, the same 12 state-of-the-art test case prioritization techniques were identified by both the expert system and the manual method. That is, the 27 papers missed by the expert system would not have changed the conclusion of the literature review. Hence, if this result generalizes, it endorses the use of our expert system to assist in literature reviews.}

The effect of approach is presented by a demonstration experiment which compares its results with the results of a classic manual screening. Finally, the recommendations for the proper use of the approach (i.e., the size of the pilot set and decision rule structure) are presented.}

abstract = {This paper presents a research and its results in the domain of higher education's pedagogical patterns for remote assessments - precisely in the computer science, software engineering and informatics-related courses. This research was motivated by the COVID-19 crisis, which separated teachers, teaching assistants, and students physically. During this period, remote knowledge assessment was one of the most challenging among all educational activities. The lack of available resources and advice on remote knowledge assessment revealed a need for a specialized assessment pattern catalog. The main result of the research is the assessment pattern catalog that started to grow organically at the Institute of Informatics, where we teach IT-related courses. We started with the initial set of patterns, identified by analyzing recurring practices, applied by teaching staff for remote assessments in the period from March 2020 till December 2020. The patterns were aggregated and gradually refined using a systematic approach. In addition to guided workshops, a systematic literature review was employed, followed by catalog refinements, and, finally, an extensive survey was carried out among teachers and teaching assistants. The latter was used as a validation of the correctness of the novel assessment pattern catalog, as well as the presented patterns’ suitability and popularity among users. The resulting assessment pattern catalog presented in this paper boasts 47 patterns, classified into four main categories, that support the whole process of (remote) assessment. It is organized and documented systematically. It also boasts several indicators per each pattern to demonstrate its suitability for distant assessments, popularity rankings among teachers, teaching assistants, and top picks in every category per teachers and teaching assistants. The survey that we performed revealed a subset of patterns that are important for a successful remote assessment, validated in the IT-related courses. Based on the results, the presented assessment pattern catalog showed itself to be useful not only for the remote assessment but also for judging knowledge in the classroom successfully.}

abstract = {Context:
DevOps (Development and Operations) has become one of the fastest-growing software development paradigms in the industry. However, this trend has presented the challenge of ensuring secure software delivery while maintaining the agility of DevOps. The efforts to integrate security in DevOps have resulted in the DevSecOps paradigm, which is gaining significant interest from both industry and academia. However, the adoption of DevSecOps in practice is proving to be a challenge.
Objective:
This study aims to systemize the knowledge about the challenges faced by practitioners when adopting DevSecOps and the proposed solutions reported in the literature. We also aim to identify the areas that need further research in the future.
Method:
We conducted a Systematic Literature Review of 54 peer-reviewed studies. The thematic analysis method was applied to analyze the extracted data.
Results:
We identified 21 challenges related to adopting DevSecOps, 31 specific solutions, and the mapping between these findings. We also determined key gap areas in this domain by holistically evaluating the available solutions against the challenges. The results of the study were classified into four themes: People, Practices, Tools, and Infrastructure. Our findings demonstrate that tool-related challenges and solutions were the most frequently reported, driven by the need for automation in this paradigm. Shift-left security and continuous security assessment were two key practices recommended for DevSecOps. People-related factors were considered critical for successful DevSecOps adoption but less studied.
Conclusions:
We highlight the need for developer-centered application security testing tools that target the continuous practices in DevSecOps. More research is needed on how the traditionally manual security practices can be automated to suit rapid software deployment cycles. Finally, achieving a suitable balance between the speed of delivery and security is a significant issue practitioners face in the DevSecOps paradigm.}

In this research, 128 criteria for team formation are proposed for building teams for self-managing software engineering capstone projects. A comparison is also conducted to ascertain the level of cohesion among those teams that were formed using the proposed criteria and those that were not formed using the proposed criteria. The criteria were identified through a combination of qualitative questionnaire survey targeted at the graduated students of the past batches of Computer Science degree program and through synthesizing the literature on engineering capstone project teams identified under the guidance of KSAO framework for software engineering students. To check the effectiveness of the criteria, 100 students were asked to form the teams using the proposed criteria and other 100 students formed the teams without the proposed criteria. Those students that had used the proposed criteria for building teams and those that had formed teams without using the proposed criteria were asked to fill the modified Group Environment Questionnaire to ascertain the level of cohesion among the team members. The results were analyzed qualitatively and through descriptive quantification. The results show that the level of cohesion in teams that were formed using the proposed team building criteria was higher. There was a need for team building criteria in the literature on software engineering capstone project teams that conforms to a conceptual, theoretical framework; this gap is now filled through this research. This paper may also serve as a literature review paper for some readers.}

abstract = {Context:
Mining Software Repositories (MSR) is a growing area of Software Engineering (SE) research. Since their emergence in 2004, many investigations have analysed different aspects of these studies. However, there are no guidelines on how to conduct systematic MSR studies. There is a need to evaluate how MSR research is approached to provide a framework to do so systematically.
Objective:
To identify how MSR studies are conducted in terms of repository selection and data extraction. To uncover potential for improvement in directing systematic research and providing guidelines to do so.
Method:
A systematic literature review of MSR studies was conducted following the guidelines and template proposed by Mian et al. (which refines those provided by Kitchenham and Charters). These guidelines were extended and revised to provide a framework for systematic MSR studies.
Results:
MSR studies typically do not follow a systematic approach for repository selection, and many do not report selection or data extraction protocols. Furthermore, few manuscripts discuss threats to the study’s validity due to the selection or data extraction steps followed.
Conclusions:
Although MSR studies are evidence-based research, they seldom follow a systematic process. Hence, there is a need for guidelines on how to conduct systematic MSR studies. New guidelines and a template have been proposed, consolidating related studies in the MSR field and strategies for systematic literature reviews.}

This paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) to survey the existing NeuroSE literature. Based on a rigorous search protocol, we identified 89 papers (hereafter denoted as NeuroSE papers). We analyzed these papers to develop a comprehensive understanding of who had published NeuroSE research and classified the contributions according to their type. The 47 articles presenting completed empirical research were analyzed in detail. The SLR revealed that the number of authors publishing NeuroSE research is still relatively small. The thematic focus so far has been on code comprehension, while code inspection, programming, and bug fixing have been less frequently studied. NeuroSE publications primarily used methods related to brain activity measurement (particularly fMRI and EEG), while methods related to the measurement of autonomic nervous system activity (e.g., pupil dilation, heart rate, skin conductance) received less attention. We also present details of how the empirical research was conducted, including stimuli and independent and dependent variables, and discuss implications for future research. The body of NeuroSE literature is still small. Yet, high quality contributions exist constituting a valuable basis for future studies.}

Software engineering researchers have undertaken many experiments investigating the potential of software defect prediction algorithms. Unfortunately some widely used performance metrics are known to be problematic, most notably F1, but nevertheless F1 is widely used.
Objective:
To investigate the potential impact of using F1 on the validity of this large body of research.
Method:
We undertook a systematic review to locate relevant experiments and then extract all pairwise comparisons of defect prediction performance using F1 and the unbiased Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC).
Results:
We found a total of 38 primary studies. These contain 12,471 pairs of results. Of these comparisons, 21.95% changed direction when the MCC metric is used instead of the biased F1 metric. Unfortunately, we also found evidence suggesting that F1 remains widely used in software defect prediction research.
Conclusion:
We reiterate the concerns of statisticians that the F1 is a problematic metric outside of an information retrieval context, since we are concerned about both classes (defect-prone and not defect-prone units). This inappropriate usage has led to a substantial number (more than one fifth) of erroneous (in terms of direction) results. Therefore we urge researchers to (i) use an unbiased metric and (ii) publish detailed results including confusion matrices such that alternative analyses become possible.}

abstract = {Background:
The development of scientific software applications is far from trivial, due to the constant increase in the necessary complexity of these applications, their increasing size, and their need for intensive maintenance and reuse.
Aim:
To this end, developers of scientific software (who usually lack a formal computer science background) need to use appropriate software engineering (SE) practices. This paper describes the results of a systematic mapping study on the use of SE for scientific application development and their impact on software quality.
Method:
To achieve this goal we have performed a systematic mapping study on 359 papers. We first describe a catalog of SE practices used in scientific software development. Then, we discuss the quality attributes of interest that drive the application of these practices, as well as tentative side-effects of applying the practices on qualities.
Results:
The main findings indicate that scientific software developers are focusing on practices that improve implementation productivity, such as code reuse, use of third-party libraries, and the application of “good” programming techniques. In addition, apart from the finding that performance is a key-driver for many of these applications, scientific software developers also find maintainability and productivity to be important.
Conclusions:
The results of the study are compared to existing literature, are interpreted under a software engineering prism, and various implications for researchers and practitioners are provided. One of the key findings of the study, which is considered as important for driving future research endeavors is the lack of evidence on the trade-offs that need to be made when applying a software practice, i.e., negative (indirect) effects on other quality attributes.}

abstract = {Context:
Scheduling in cloud is complicated as a result of multi-tenancy. Diverse tenants have different requirements, including service functions, response time, QoS and throughput. Diverse tenants require different scheduling capabilities, resource consumption and competition. Multi-tenancy scheduling approaches have been developed for different service models, such as Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a service (PaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), and Database as a Service (DBaaS).
Objective:
In this paper, we survey the current landscape of multi-tenancy scheduling, laying out the challenges and complexity of software engineering where multi-tenancy issues are involved. This study emphasises scheduling policies, cloud provisioning and deployment with regards to multi-tenancy issues. We conduct a systematic literature review of research studies related to multi-tenancy scheduling approaches on cloud platforms determine the primary scheduling approaches currently used and the challenges for addressing key multi-tenancy scheduling issues.
Method:
We adopted a systematic literature review method to search and review many major journal and conference papers on four major online electronic databases, which address our four predefined research questions. Defining inclusion and exclusion criteria was the initial step before extracting data from the selected papers and deriving answers addressing our enquiries.
Results:
Finally, 53 papers were selected, of which 62 approaches were identified. Most of these methods are developed without cloud layers’ limitation (43.40%) and on SaaS, most of scheduling approaches are oriented to framework design (43.75%).
Conclusion:
The results have demonstrated most of multi-tenancy scheduling solutions can work at any delivery layer. With the difference of tenants’ requirements and functionalities, the choice of cloud service delivery models is changed. Based on our study, designing a multi-tenancy scheduling framework should consider the following 3 factors: computing, QoS and storage resource. One of the potential research foci of multi-tenancy scheduling approaches is on GPU scheduling.}

keywords = {Gray literature review, Evidence-based software engineering, DevSecOps},
abstract = {Context:
Systematic Literature Review (SLR), as a tool of Evidence-Based Software Engineering (EBSE), has been widely used in Software Engineering (SE). However, for certain topics in SE, especially those that are trendy or industry driven, academic literature is generally scarce and consequently Gray Literature (GL) becomes a major source of evidence. In recent years, the adoption of Gray Literature Review (GLR) or Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) is rising steadily to provide the state-of-the-practice of a specific topic where SLR is not a viable option.
Objective:
Although some SLR guidelines recommend the use of GL and several MLR guidelines have already been proposed in SE, researchers still have conflicting views on the value of GL and commonly accepted GLR or MLR studies are generally lacking in terms of publication. This experience report aims to shed some light on GLR through a case study that uses SLR and MLR guidelines to conduct a GLR on an emerging topic in SE to specifically answer the questions related to the reasons of using GL, the processes of conducting GL, and the impacts of GL on review results.
Method:
We retrospect the review process of conducting a GLR on the topic of DevSecOps with reference to Kitchenham’s SLR and Garousi’s MLR guidelines. We specifically reflect on the processes we had to adapt in order to tackle the challenges we faced. We also compare and contrast our GLR with existing MLRs or GLRs in SE to contextualize our reflections.
Results:
We distill ten challenges in nine activities of a GLR process. We provide reasons for these challenges and further suggest ways to tackle them during a GLR process. We also discuss the decision process of selecting a suitable review methodology among SLR, MLR and GLR and elaborate the impacts of GL on our review results.
Conclusion:
Although our experience on GLR is mainly derived from a specific case study on DevSecOps, we conjecture that it is relevant and would be beneficial to other GLR or MLR studies. We also expect our experience would contribute to future GLR or MLR guidelines, in a way similar to how SLR guidelines learned from the SLR experience report a dozen years ago. In addition, other researchers may find our decision making process useful before they conduct their own reviews.}

GL is often defined as “literature that is not formally published in sources such as books or journal articles”, e.g., in the form of trade magazines, online blog-posts, technical reports, and online videos such as tutorial and presentation videos. GL is typically produced by SE practitioners. We have observed that researchers are increasingly using and benefitting from the knowledge available within GL. Related to the notion of GL is the notion of Multivocal Literature Reviews (MLRs) in SE, i.e., a MLR is a form of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) which includes knowledge and/or evidence from the GL in addition to the peer-reviewed literature. MLRs are useful for both researchers and practitioners because they provide summaries of both the state-of-the-art and -practice in a given area. MLRs are popular in other fields and have started to appear in SE community. It is timely then for a Special Issue (SI) focusing on GL and MLRs in SE. From the pool of 13 submitted papers, and after following a rigorous peer review process, seven papers were accepted for this SI. In this introduction we provide a brief overview of GL and MLRs in SE, and then a brief summary of the seven papers published in this SI.}

This involves collecting runtime data from the system so that it is possible to analyze the collected data to guide actions upon the system. Consequently, software monitoring imposes practical challenges because it is often done by intercepting the system execution and recording gathered information. Such monitoring may degrade the performance and disrupt the system execution to unacceptable levels. In this paper, we introduce a two-phase monitoring approach to support the monitoring step in adaptive systems. The first phase collects lightweight coarse-grained information and identifies relevant parts of the software that should be monitored in detail based on a provided domain-specific language. This language is informed by a systematic literature review. The second phase collects relevant and fine-grained information needed for deciding whether and how to adapt the managed system. Our approach is implemented as a framework, called Tigris, that can be seamlessly integrated into existing software systems to support monitoring-based activities. To validate our proposal, we instantiated Tigris to support an application-level caching approach, which adapts caching decisions of a software system at runtime to improve its performance.}

abstract = {Several prediction approaches are contained in the arena of software engineering such as prediction of effort, security, quality, fault, cost, and re-usability. All these prediction approaches are still in the rudimentary phase. Experiments and research are conducting to build a robust model. Software Fault Prediction (SFP) is the process to develop the model which can be utilized by software practitioners to detect faulty classes/module before the testing phase. Prediction of defective modules before the testing phase will help the software development team leader to allocate resources more optimally and it reduces the testing effort. In this article, we present a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of various studies from 1990 to June 2019 towards applying machine learning and statistical method over software fault prediction. We have cited 208 research articles, in which we studied 154 relevant articles. We investigated the competence of machine learning in existing datasets and research projects. To the best of our knowledge, the existing SLR considered only a few parameters over SFP’s performance, and they partially examined the various threats and challenges of SFP techniques. In this article, we aggregated those parameters and analyzed them accordingly, and we also illustrate the different challenges in the SFP domain. We also compared the performance between machine learning and statistical techniques based on SFP models. Our empirical study and analysis demonstrate that the prediction ability of machine learning techniques for classifying class/module as fault/non-fault prone is better than classical statistical models. The performance of machine learning-based SFP methods over fault susceptibility is better than conventional statistical purposes. The empirical evidence of our survey reports that the machine learning techniques have the capability, which can be used to identify fault proneness, and able to form well-generalized result. We have also investigated a few challenges in fault prediction discipline, i.e., quality of data, over-fitting of models, and class imbalance problem. We have also summarized 154 articles in a tabular form for quick identification.}

A good search strategy is essential for a successful systematic literature study. Historically, database searches have been the norm, which was later complemented with snowball searches. Our conjecture is that we can perform even better searches if combining these two search approaches, referred to as a hybrid search strategy.
Objective:
Our main objective was to compare and evaluate a hybrid search strategy. Furthermore, we compared four alternative hybrid search strategies to assess whether we could identify more cost-efficient ways of searching for relevant primary studies.
Methods:
To compare and evaluate the hybrid search strategy, we replicated the search procedure in a systematic literature review (SLR) on industry–academia collaboration in software engineering. The SLR used a more “traditional” approach to searching for relevant articles for an SLR, while our replication was executed using a hybrid search strategy.
Results:
In our evaluation, the hybrid search strategy was superior in identifying relevant primary studies. It identified 30% more primary studies and even more studies when focusing only on peer-reviewed articles. To embrace individual viewpoints when assessing research articles and minimise the risk of missing primary studies, we introduced two new concepts, wild cards and borderline articles, when performing systematic literature studies.
Conclusions:
The hybrid search strategy is a strong contender for being used when performing systematic literature studies. Furthermore, alternative hybrid search strategies may be viable if selected wisely in relation to the start set for snowballing. Finally, the two new concepts were judged as essential to cater for different individual judgements and to minimise the risk of excluding primary studies that ought to be included.}

abstract = {Change Impact Analysis (CIA) is the process of exploring the tentative effects of a change in other parts of a system. CIA is considered beneficial in practice, since it reduces cost of maintenance and the risk of software development failures. In this paper, we present a systematic mapping study that covers a plethora of CIA methods (by exploring 111 papers), putting special emphasis on how the CIA phenomenon can be quantified: to be efficiently managed. The results of our study suggest that: (a) the practical benefits of CIA cover any type of maintenance request (e.g., feature additions, bug fixing) and can help in reducing relevant cost; (b) CIA quantification relies on four parameters (instability, amount of change, change proneness, and changeability), whose assessment is supported by various metrics and predictors; and (c) in this vast research field, there are still some viewpoints that remain unexplored (e.g., the negative consequences of highly change prone artifacts), whereas others are over-researched (e.g., quantification of instability based on metrics). Based on our results, we provide: (a) useful information for practitioners—i.e., the expected benefits of CIA, and a list of CIA-related metrics, emphasizing on the provision of a detailed interpretation of their relation to CIA; and (b) interesting future research directions—i.e., over- and under-researched sub-fields of CIA.}

abstract = {Context:
Software development is a collaborative task. Previous research has shown social aspects within development teams to be highly relevant for the success of software projects. A team’s mood has been proven to be particularly important. It is paramount for project managers to be aware of negative moods within their teams, as such awareness enables them to intervene. Sentiment analysis tools offer a way to determine the mood of a team based on textual communication.
Objective:
We aim to help developers or stakeholders in their choice of sentiment analysis tools for their specific purpose. Therefore, we conducted a systematic mapping study (SMS).
Methods:
We present the results of our SMS of sentiment analysis tools developed for or applied in the context of software engineering (SE). Our results summarize insights from 106 papers with respect to (1) the application domain, (2) the purpose, (3) the used data sets, (4) the approaches for developing sentiment analysis tools, (5) the usage of already existing tools, and (6) the difficulties researchers face. We analyzed in more detail which tools and approaches perform how in terms of their performance.
Results:
According to our results, sentiment analysis is frequently applied to open-source software projects, and most approaches are neural networks or support-vector machines. The best performing approach in our analysis is neural networks and the best tool is BERT. Despite the frequent use of sentiment analysis in SE, there are open issues, e.g. regarding the identification of irony or sarcasm, pointing to future research directions.
Conclusion:
We conducted an SMS to gain an overview of the current state of sentiment analysis in order to help developers or stakeholders in this matter. Our results include interesting findings e.g. on the used tools and their difficulties. We present several suggestions on how to solve these identified problems.}

Other disciplines commonly employ secondary studies to address the needs of practitioners and policy-makers. Since being adopted by software engineering in 2004, many have been undertaken by researchers.
Objective:
To assess how the role of secondary studies in software engineering has evolved.
Methods:
We examined a sample of 131 secondary studies published in a set of five major software engineering journals for the years 2010, 2015 and 2020. These were categorised by their type (e.g. mapping study), their research focus (quantitative/qualitative and practice/methodological), as well as the experience of the first authors.
Results:
Secondary studies are now a well-established research tool. They are predominantly qualitative and there is extensive use of mapping studies to profile research in particular areas. A significant number are clearly produced as part of postgraduate study, although experienced researchers also conduct many secondary studies. They are sometimes also used as part of a multi-method study.
Conclusion:
Existing guidelines largely focus upon quantitative systematic reviews. Based on our findings, we suggest that more guidance is needed on how to conduct, analyse, and report qualitative secondary studies.}

Advancements in machine learning (ML) lead to a shift from the traditional view of software development, where algorithms are hard-coded by humans, to ML systems materialized through learning from data. Therefore, we need to revisit our ways of developing software systems and consider the particularities required by these new types of systems.
Objective:
The purpose of this study is to systematically identify, analyze, summarize, and synthesize the current state of software engineering (SE) research for engineering ML systems.
Method:
I performed a systematic literature review (SLR). I systematically selected a pool of 141 studies from SE venues and then conducted a quantitative and qualitative analysis using the data extracted from these studies.
Results:
The non-deterministic nature of ML systems complicates all SE aspects of engineering ML systems. Despite increasing interest from 2018 onwards, the results reveal that none of the SE aspects have a mature set of tools and techniques. Testing is by far the most popular area among researchers. Even for testing ML systems, engineers have only some tool prototypes and solution proposals with weak experimental proof. Many of the challenges of ML systems engineering were identified through surveys and interviews. Researchers should conduct experiments and case studies, ideally in industrial environments, to further understand these challenges and propose solutions.
Conclusion:
The results may benefit (1) practitioners in foreseeing the challenges of ML systems engineering; (2) researchers and academicians in identifying potential research questions; and (3) educators in designing or updating SE courses to cover ML systems engineering.}

Hundreds of configuration options, features, or plugins can be combined, each potentially with distinct functionality and effects on execution time, security, energy consumption, etc. Due to the combinatorial explosion and the cost of executing software, it is quickly impossible to exhaustively explore the whole configuration space. Hence, numerous works have investigated the idea of learning it from a small sample of configurations’ measurements. The pattern “sampling, measuring, learning” has emerged in the literature, with several practical interests for both software developers and end-users of configurable systems. In this systematic literature review, we report on the different application objectives (e.g., performance prediction, configuration optimization, constraint mining), use-cases, targeted software systems, and application domains. We review the various strategies employed to gather a representative and cost-effective sample. We describe automated software techniques used to measure functional and non-functional properties of configurations. We classify machine learning algorithms and how they relate to the pursued application. Finally, we also describe how researchers evaluate the quality of the learning process. The findings from this systematic review show that the potential application objective is important; there are a vast number of case studies reported in the literature related to particular domains or software systems. Yet, the huge variant space of configurable systems is still challenging and calls to further investigate the synergies between artificial intelligence and software engineering.}

abstract = {Context
The current technology revolution has posed unexpected challenges for the software industry. In recent years, the field of quantum computing (QC) technologies has continued to grow in influence and maturity, and it is now poised to revolutionise software engineering. However, the evaluation and prioritisation of QC challenges in the software industry remain unexplored, relatively under-identified and fragmented.
Objective
The purpose of this study is to identify, examine and prioritise the most critical challenges in the software industry by implementing a fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (F-AHP).
Method
First, to identify the key challenges, we conducted a systematic literature review by drawing data from the four relevant digital libraries and supplementing these efforts with a forward and backward snowballing search. Second, we followed the F-AHP approach to evaluate and rank the identified challenges, or barriers.
Results
The results show that the key barriers to QC adoption are the lack of technical expertise, information accuracy and organisational interest in adopting the new process. Another critical barrier is the lack of standards of secure communication techniques for implementing QC.
Conclusion
By applying F-AHP, we identified institutional barriers as the highest and organisational barriers as the second highest global weight ranked categories among the main QC challenges facing the software industry. We observed that the highest-ranked local barriers facing the software technology industry are the lack of resources for design and initiative while the lack of organisational interest in adopting the new process is the most significant organisational barrier. Our findings, which entail implications for both academicians and practitioners, reveal the emergent nature of QC research and the increasing need for interdisciplinary research to address the identified challenges.}

Systematic Literature Review (SLR) studies aim to identify relevant primary papers, extract the required data, analyze, and synthesize results to gain further and broader insight into the investigated domain. Multiple SLR studies have been conducted in several domains, such as software engineering, medicine, and pharmacy. Conducting an SLR is a time-consuming, laborious, and costly effort. As such, several researchers developed different techniques to automate the SLR process. However, a systematic overview of the current state-of-the-art in SLR automation seems to be lacking.
Objective
This study aims to collect and synthesize the studies that focus on the automation of SLR to pave the way for further research.
Method
A systematic literature review is conducted on published primary studies on the automation of SLR studies, in which 41 primary studies have been analyzed.
Results
This SLR identifies the objectives of automation studies, application domains, automated steps of the SLR, automation techniques, and challenges and solution directions.
Conclusion
According to our study, the leading automated step is the Selection of Primary Studies. Although many studies have provided automation approaches for systematic literature reviews, no study has been found to apply automation techniques in the planning and reporting phase. Further research is needed to support the automation of the other activities of the SLR process.}

Objective: The research on mobile app privacy has experienced rapid growth over the past decade. This line of research is aimed at systematically exposing the privacy practices of apps and proposing solutions to protect the privacy of mobile app users. In this paper, we conduct a systematic mapping study of this body of research. Our objectives are to a) explore trends in SE app privacy research, b) categorize existing evidence, and c) identify potential directions for future research. Method: A systematic mapping study of 59 Software Engineering (SE) primary studies on mobile app privacy. Our scope is studies published in software engineering venues between 2008 and 2018. Results: Our results show that existing literature can be divided into four main categories: privacy policy, requirements, user perspective, and leak detection. Furthermore, our survey reveals an imbalance between these categories—the majority of existing research focuses on proposing tools for detecting privacy leaks, with fewer studies targeting privacy requirements and policy and even fewer on user perspective. Conclusions: Our survey exposes several gaps in existing research and suggests areas for improvement.}

The usefulness of the checklist was perceived more positively by researchers than practitioners, though they highlighted benefits (raising awareness of the importance of context and usefulness for management). The understandability was perceived positively by both practitioners and researchers. The checklist may serve as a “meta-model”, forming the basis for specific adaptations for different research areas, and as input for researchers deciding which context information to extract in systematic reviews.

However, while it is widely accepted that high quality matters in code comments just as it matters in source code, assessing comment quality in practice is still an open problem. First and foremost, there is no unique definition of quality when it comes to evaluating code comments. The few existing studies on this topic rather focus on specific attributes of quality that can be easily quantified and measured. Existing techniques and corresponding tools may also focus on comments bound to a specific programming language, and may only deal with comments with specific scopes and clear goals (e.g., Javadoc comments at the method level, or in-body comments describing TODOs to be addressed). In this paper, we present a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of the last decade of research in SE to answer the following research questions: (i) What types of comments do researchers focus on when assessing comment quality? (ii) What quality attributes (QAs) do they consider? (iii) Which tools and techniques do they use to assess comment quality?, and (iv) How do they evaluate their studies on comment quality assessment in general? Our evaluation, based on the analysis of 2353 papers and the actual review of 47 relevant ones, shows that (i) most studies and techniques focus on comments in Java code, thus may not be generalizable to other languages, and (ii) the analyzed studies focus on four main QAs of a total of 21 QAs identified in the literature, with a clear predominance of checking consistency between comments and the code. We observe that researchers rely on manual assessment and specific heuristics rather than the automated assessment of the comment quality attributes, with evaluations often involving surveys of students and the authors of the original studies but rarely professional developers.}

The key finding in this study are: a) the majority of the studies were published over two decades from 1989 to 2009, and then the publication rate slowed in the following decade; b) the largest number of SEP, by far, was proposed by Davis; c) only six studies used explicit criteria to identify their proposed SEP, and the other 24 studies identified their principles based on their own analysis without traceability to a methodology or selection criteria; d) most authors did not identify which principles to use in specific contexts of the software engineering domain; e) only two studies used some of the proposed SEP throughout the software development process.}

Objective: This study aims to investigate the evidence-based state-of-the-art of QAs of microservices-based systems. Method: We carried out a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to identify and synthesize the relevant studies that report evidence related to QAs of MSA. Results: Based on the data extracted from the 72 selected primary studies, we portray an overview of the six identified QAs most concerned in MSA, scalability, performance, availability, monitorability, security, and testability. We identify 19 tactics that architecturally address the critical QAs in MSA, including two tactics for scalability, four for performance, four for availability, four for monitorability, three for security, and two for testability. Conclusion: This SLR concludes that for MSA-based systems: 1) Although scalability is the commonly acknowledged benefit of MSA, it is still an indispensable concern among the identified QAs, especially when trading-off with other QAs, e.g., performance. Apart from the six identified QAs in this study, other QAs for MSA like maintainability need more attention for effective improvement and evaluation in the future. 3) Practitioners need to carefully make the decision of migrating to MSA based on the return on investment, since this architectural style additionally cause some pains in practice.}

Objective:
This paper aims to characterize how gamification has been adopted in non-educational contexts of software engineering (SE) activities.
Methods:
We performed a Systematic Mapping of the literature obtained from relevant databases of the area. The searches retrieved 2640 studies (published up to January 2020), of which 548 were duplicates, 82 were selected after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and 21 were included via the backward snowballing technique, thus reaching a total of 103 studies to be analyzed.
Results:
Gamification provided benefits to activities like requirements specification, development, testing, project management, and support process. There is evidence of gamified support to some CMMI 2.0 Practice Areas. The most commonly used gamification elements are points and leaderboards. The main benefit achieved is the increased engagement and motivation to perform tasks.
Conclusion:
The number of publications and new research initiatives have increased over the years and, from the original authors’ reports, many positive results were achieved in SE activities. Despite this, gamification can still be explored for many SE tasks; for the addressed ones, empirical evidence is very limited.}

This result reinforces that, in fact, accessibility is not characterized as a property of the final software only. Instead, it evolves over the software life cycle.

abstract = {Context:
Security and performance are critical software non-functional requirements. Therefore, verification activities should be included in the development process to identify related defects, avoiding failures after deployment. However, there is a lack of understanding on factors moderating the security and performance verification, which jeopardizes organizations to improve their verification activities to assure the releasing of software fulfilling these requirements.
Objective:
To identify moderator factors influencing security and performance verification and actions to promote them.
Methods:
Case study to identify security and performance moderators factors. Rapid Literature Reviews with Snowballing to strengthen moderator factors confidence. Practitioners Survey to classify the moderator factors relevance.
Results:
Identification of eight security and performance moderator factors regarding organizational awareness, cross-functional team, suitable requirements, support tools, verification environment, verification methodology, verification planning, and reuse practices. Rapid Reviews confirmed the moderator factors and revealed actions to promote each. A survey with 37 practitioners allowed us to classify the moderator factors and their actions regarding their relevancy.
Conclusions:
The moderator factors can be considered key points to software development organizations implement/improve security and performance verification activities in regular software systems. Further investigation is necessary to support the understanding of these moderator factors when building modern software systems.}

keywords = {Systematic Literature Review, Model Driven Development, Mobile App, Tools and Techniques},
abstract = {Context:
Mobile applications (known as “apps”) usage continues to rapidly increase, with many new apps being developed and deployed. However, developing a mobile app is challenging due to its dependencies on devices, technologies, platforms, and deadlines to reach the market. One potential approach is to use Model Driven Development (MDD) techniques that simplify the app development process, reduce complexity, increase abstraction level, help achieve scalable solutions and maximize cost-effectiveness and productivity.
Objective:
This paper systematically investigates what MDD techniques and methodologies have been used to date to support mobile app development and how these techniques have been employed, to identify key benefits, limitations, gaps and future research potential.
Method:
A Systematic Literature Review approach was used for this study based on a formal protocol. The rigorous search protocol identified a total of 1,042 peer-reviewed academic research papers from four major software engineering databases. These papers were subsequently filtered, and 55 high quality relevant studies were selected for analysis, synthesis, and reporting.
Results:
We identified the popularity of different applied MDD approaches, supporting tools, artifacts, and evaluation techniques. Our analysis found that architecture, domain model, and code generation are the most crucial purposes in MDD-based app development. Three qualities – productivity, scalability and reliability – can benefit from these modeling strategies. We then summarize the key collective strengths, limitations, gaps from the studies and made several future recommendations.
Conclusion:
There has been a steady interest in MDD approaches applied to mobile app development over the years. This paper guides future researchers, developers, and stakeholders to improve app development techniques, ultimately that will help end-users in having more effective apps, especially when some recommendations are addressed, e.g., taking into account more human-centric aspects in app development.}

author = {Tomasz Lewowski and Lech Madeyski},
keywords = {Software engineering, Code smells, Reproducibility, Reproducible research},
abstract = {Context:
Code smells are symptoms of wrong design decisions or coding shortcuts that may increase defect rate and decrease maintainability. Research on code smells is accelerating, focusing on code smell detection and using code smells as defect predictors. Recent research shows that even between software developers, agreement on what constitutes a code smell is low, but several publications claim the high performance of detection algorithms—which seems counterintuitive, considering that algorithms should be taught on data labeled by developers.
Objective:
This paper aims to investigate the possible reasons for the inconsistencies between studies in the performance of applied machine learning algorithms compared to developers. It focuses on the reproducibility of existing studies.
Methods:
A systematic literature review was performed among conference and journal articles published between 1999 and 2020 to assess the state of reproducibility of the research performed in those papers. A quasi-gold standard procedure was used to validate the search. Modeling process descriptions, reproduction scripts, data sets, and techniques used for their creation were analyzed.
Results:
We obtained data from 46 publications. 22 of them contained a detailed description of the modeling process, 17 included any reproduction data (data set, results, or scripts) and 15 used existing data sets. In most of the publications, analyzed projects were hand-picked by the researchers.
Conclusion:
Most studies do not include any form of an online reproduction package, although this has started to change recently—8% of analyzed studies published before 2018 included a full reproduction package, compared to 22% in years 2018–2019. Ones that do include a package usually use a research group website or even a personal one. Dedicated archives are still rarely used for data packages. We recommend that researchers include complete reproduction packages for their studies and use well-established research data archives instead of their own websites.}

abstract = {Context:
Cognitive load in software engineering refers to the mental effort users spend while reading software artifacts. The cognitive load can vary according to tasks and across developers. Researchers have measured developers’ cognitive load for different purposes, such as understanding its impact on productivity and software quality. Thus, researchers and practitioners can use cognitive load measures for solving many aspects of software engineering problems.
Problem:
However, a lack of a classification of dimensions on cognitive load measures in software engineering makes it difficult for researchers and practitioners to obtain research trends to advance scientific knowledge or apply it in software projects.
Objective:
This article aims to classify different aspects of cognitive load measures in software engineering and identify challenges for further research.
Method:
We conducted a Systematic Mapping Study (SMS), which started with 4,175 articles gathered from 11 search engines and then narrowed down to 63 primary studies.
Results:
Our main findings are: (1) 43% (27/63) of the primary studies focused on applying a combination of sensors; (2) 81% (51/63) of the selected works were validation studies; (3) 83% (52/63) of the primary studies analyzed cognitive load while developers performed programming tasks. Moreover, we created a classification scheme based on the answers to our research questions.
Conclusion:
despite the production of a significant amount of studies on cognitive load in software engineering, there are still many challenges to be solved in this particular field for effectively measuring the cognitive load in software engineering. Therefore, this work provided directions for future studies on cognitive load measurement in software engineering.}

abstract = {Smart contracts (SC) run on blockchain technology (BCT) to implement agreements between several parties. As BCT grows, organizations aim to automate their processes and engage in business collaborations using SCs. The translation of contract semantics into SC language semantics is difficult due to ambiguous contractual interpretation by the several parties and the developers. Also, an SC language itself misses the language constructs needed for semantically expressing collaboration terms. This leads to SC coding errors that result in contractual conflicts over transactions during the performance of SCs and thus, novel SC solutions incur high development and maintenance costs. Various model-based and no/low code development approaches address this issue by enabling higher abstractions in SC development. Still, the question remains unanswered how contractual parties, i.e., end-users with non-IT skills, manage to develop legally relevant SCs with ease. This study aims to (1) identify and categorize the state of the art of SC automation models, in terms of their technical features, and their legal significance, and to (2) identify new research opportunities. The review has been conducted as a systematic literature review (SLR) that follows the guidelines proposed by Kitchenham for performing SLRs in software-engineering. As a result of the implementation of the review protocol, 1367 papers are collected, and 33 of them are selected for extraction and analysis. The contributions of this article are threefold: (1) 10 different SC automation models/frameworks are identified and classified according to their technical and implementation features; (2) 11 different legal contract parameters are identified and categorized into 4 legal criteria classes; (3) a comparative analysis of SC-automation models in the context of their legal significance is conducted that identifies the degrees to which the SC-automation models are considered legally relevant. As a conclusion, we produce a comprehensive and replicable overview of the state of the art of SC automation models and a systematic measure of their legal significance to benefit practitioners in the field.}

This paper aims to identify the accessibility barriers that occur when using design patterns for building user interfaces of mobile apps and propose guidelines to prevent the problems most often encountered. We start by conducting a gray literature review in professional forums and blogs to reveal the difficulties developers face when using mobile user interface design patterns. We thus compiled a catalog which contains the descriptions of 9 user interface design patterns, the accessibility barriers linked to the use of each pattern and the guidelines that can be followed to prevent the problem of these barriers. We carried out an evaluation of the use of the catalog with 60 participants. Our results show that in most cases, the guidelines were correctly applied for the prototyping of mobile user interfaces. The findings also revealed the usefulness and ease-of-use of the guidelines from the perspective of the participants.}

keywords = {Process models, Agile methodologies, Multi-method, Literature review, Thematic synthesis, Focus group},
abstract = {Context:
Agile methodologies and frameworks are widely used in software development projects because of their support for continuous change and delivery. Agile software development advocates de-prioritizing aspects such as processes and documentation. In traditional software engineering methodologies, however, business process models have been extensively used to support these aspects. Up until now, it is unclear to what extent recommendations to focus on code imply that conceptual modeling should be discontinued.
Objective:
The objective of this study is to investigate this hypothesis. More specifically, we develop a theoretical argument of how business process models are and can be used to support agile software development projects.
Method:
To this end, we use a multi-method study design. First, we conduct a systematic literature review, in which we identify studies on the usage of business process models in agile software development. Second, we apply procedures from thematic synthesis to analyze the connection between these uses and the phases of the development cycle. Third, we use a focus group design with practitioners to systematically reflect upon how these uses can help regarding four categories of challenges in agile software development: management, team, technology, and process.
Results:
From 37 relevant studies, we distill 15 different uses. The results highlight the benefits of process modeling as an instrument to support agile software development projects from different angles and in all project phases. Process modeling appears to be particularly relevant for the first phases of the development cycle, and for management and process issues in agile projects.
Conclusion:
We conclude that business process models indeed provide benefits for agile software development projects. Our findings have practical implications and emphasize the need for future research on modeling and agile development.}

Code Review (CR) is the cornerstone for software quality assurance and a crucial practice for software development. As CR research matures, it can be difficult to keep track of the best practices and state-of-the-art in methodology, dataset, and metric.
Objective:
This paper investigates the potential of benchmarking by collecting methodology, dataset, and metric of CR studies.
Methods:
A systematic mapping study was conducted. A total of 112 studies from 19,847 papers published in high-impact venues between the years 2011 and 2019 were selected and analyzed.
Results:
First, we find that empirical evaluation is the most common methodology (65% of papers), with solution and experience being the least common methodology. Second, we highlight 50% of papers that use the quantitative method or mixed-method have the potential for replicability. Third, we identify 457 metrics that are grouped into sixteen core metric sets, applied to nine Software Engineering topics, showing different research topics tend to use specific metric sets.
Conclusion:
We conclude that at this stage, we cannot benchmark CR studies. Nevertheless, a common benchmark will facilitate new researchers, including experts from other fields, to innovate new techniques and build on top of already established methodologies.

abstract = {Context:
Startups are new and fast-growing innovative businesses. These companies also deal with uncertain market conditions and work under constant time and business pressures. Although User Experience (UX) has been widely adopted in the software industry, this has not been a reality in the context of software startups yet. Several factors might influence whether, which, and how UX is adopted by software startups.
Objective:
The objective of this paper is to investigate in the literature how software startups work with UX and to discover the relationship between software development practices and UX in startups.
Methodology:
Our methodology is composed of three main activities: (1) mapping the literature seeking publications on UX work, software engineering, and startups, which resulted in 21 relevant publications; (2) a thematic analysis based on the output of step 1 (i.e., the relevant literature); and (3) refining the themes found out in step 2 and the design of their relationships to explain the link between UX work and software startups.
Results:
The challenges, opportunities, and practices associated with UX in the context of software startups reported by the literature were organized in a set of themes. As a result, seven themes were defined so as to identify needs and opportunities related to UX work in startups. In addition, we synthesize open questions from the literature and suggest new ones to further research directions about the adoption of UX by software startups.
Conclusion:
Our findings demonstrate that software startups require an approach to UX that is more adherent to the startups’ dynamic and disruptive nature. We also suggest emerging open research questions which should be answered to promote the evolution of UX as applied to software startups.}

abstract = {Context
The higher availability of software usage data and the influence of the Lean Startup led to the rise of experimentation in software engineering, a new approach for development based on experiments to understand the user needs. In the models proposed to guide this approach, the first step is generally to identify, prioritize, and specify the hypotheses that will be tested through experimentation. However, although practitioners have proposed several techniques to handle hypotheses, the scientific literature is still scarce.
Objective
The goal of this study is to understand what activities, as proposed in industry, are entailed to handle hypotheses, facilitating the comparison, creation, and evaluation of relevant techniques.
Methods
We performed a gray literature review (GLR) on the practices proposed by practitioners to handle hypotheses in the context of software startups. We analyzed the identified documents using thematic synthesis.
Results
The analysis revealed that techniques proposed for software startups in practice compress five different activities: elicitation, prioritization, specification, analysis, and management. It also showed that practitioners often classify hypotheses in types and which qualities they aim for these statements.
Conclusion
Our results represent the first description for hypotheses engineering grounded in practice data. This mapping of the state-of-practice indicates how research could go forward in investigating hypotheses for experimentation in the context of software startups. For practitioners, they represent a catalog of available practices to be used in this context.}

Providing a better understanding what the commonalities and differences of Digital Twins in different contexts are, may allow to build reusable support for developing, running, and managing Digital Twins by providing dedicated concepts, techniques, and tool support.

In particular, we analyzed the types of research and contributions made for Digital Twins, the expected properties Digital Twins have to fulfill, how Digital Twins are realized and operated, as well as how Digital Twins are finally evaluated.

For digital games, this uniqueness reduces the opportunity for software reuse. A high-level software architecture for game mechanics, however, can still be reused where a single, specific implementation cannot. Despite that potential, existing research on game development lacks a comprehensive analysis of how game mechanics could benefit from the field of software architecture. This limits the opportunities for developers and researchers alike to benefit from findings on the subject. To help guide future research on game development, we analyzed the state-of-the-art architectures in game mechanics through a systematic literature review. This work carefully documents data from 36 studies, analyzing the reflections and compromises between design requirements, practices, and restrictions, as well as how they contribute to different types of mechanics. The main findings are that researchers favor reduced development complexity, but often tailor their solutions to specific games or genres. We conclude that a valuable avenue for future research in the field is the generalization of architectural solutions around specific types of mechanics and formalizing the use of software engineering for game mechanics.}
